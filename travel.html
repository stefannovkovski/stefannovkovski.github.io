                The previous month I visited Hamburg, Germany for the weekend and I had an incredible time filled with unforgettable experiences. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the rich history and modern charm that coexist seamlessly in Hamburg. I had the opportunity to explore the city's renowned landmarks, such as stunning castles and historic sites, which left me in awe of their beauty. The vibrant shopping districts offered a delightful mix of local boutiques and international brands, allowing me to discover unique treasures.

As I strolled along the charming streets, I couldn't help but admire the architectural marvels and picturesque landscapes that unfolded before me. The weekend in Hamburg was truly a whirlwind of excitement, cultural immersion, and exploration, leaving me with lasting memories and a deep appreciation for this extraordinary city.

                In 2021 I visited Istanbul,Turkey for one week for a Erasmus project. In this journey I was amazed by the history and modernity in this magnificent city. From the moment I arrived, I was captivated by the iconic landmarks that tell tales of a glorious past. The awe-inspiring Hagia Sophia left me breathless with its breathtaking Byzantine architecture and captivating mosaics. Nearby, the majestic Blue Mosque stood tall, showcasing its intricate tile work and graceful domes. Exploring the Topkapi Palace, I got to see how one palace with a rich history was build and I learned that  different sultans have lived there.<br><br> As I sailed along the Bosphorus on a boat,  I admired the views of the city's skyline, with the magnificent silhouette of the Maiden's Tower gracing the waters. Istanbul's rich culture also delighted my senses as I indulged in traditional Turkish cuisine, savoring succulent kebabs and flavorful baklava. Safe to say I will never forget this trip.

    <h1>A LOOK INTO MY LIFE...</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Stefan Novkovski. I am a 20 year old that lives in Kumanovo. Fuelled by my unwavering passion for technology and a burning desire to make a difference, I have embraced the challenges of being a dedicated student at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje. With each passing day, my passion for technology continues to grow, driving me to explore new frontiers and make a positive impact on the world. As I step into the future, I am confident that my unwavering commitment to learning, coupled with the support of my academic community, will propel me towards achieving greatness. This website explores my personal growth, academic pursuits, and unwavering commitment to achieving greatness. A person's personality is what makes them different from each other and makes them unique from the crowd. That’s why it is important to be able to define the characters as one's own.<br>I could probably write many paragraphs about my life, but I will try to
    be short so I can have your full attention. <br>So come and take a look into my life by viewing the other sections.</p>
